		<!--From the beginning of the design process, I knew I wanted to do something about the video game OMORI, one of the best games 
			I’ve ever played, and wanted to use this space to show off my thoughts on and love for it. There are four distinct sections on
			the page which are: the header, navigation menu, the main (which is where I put all the site content, images/text, etc), and 
			the footer. I studied the official OMORI website and recreated the intro animation for the logo of the game on the site, which 
			was extremely challenging and took several hours to get down the way I wanted it to be, in the end I think it was worth it. I 
			had the idea to make the entire page non-scrollable, only using a button (the navigation menu being a reference to a set piece 
			in the game), to make the site content appear. For navigating the page, I used the #target subclass and the <a> href attributes 
			to identify the site content to display and display it. I spent several hours getting the positioning down and figuring out
			how to make the sprites be positioned relative to the rectangle, which was very formative. Originally, I wanted the site 
			content to be in a thought bubble coming out of the player character as a unique sprite, but ran out of time. Additionally, I 
			am not too much of a fan of the coloring of the content bubble, and could not find a way around having the 
			images be reasonably sized without enabling scrolling on it, leading to the problem of the default scrolling position 
			being the bottom of the screen so the user would have to scroll UP on site open. I feel that I managed tag semantics and 
			nesting very well on this project, and my html flows well. I also ensured to control what is selectable, only allowing direct 
			text and images (not sprites) to be selected. GIF files were used sparingly as per the recommendation of the professor. -->

			<h2>Gameplay</h2>
			OMORI intertwines traditional top-down JRPG elements with psychological horror, and encourages players to traverse the 
			convoluted world forged by a mind grappling with grief and loneliness. Although featuring a relatively standard turn-based 
			combat system, the interesting-looking enemies, challenging boss fights, and fun character-specific attacks keep things feeling 
			fresh while you strive to move the story forward. On top of turn-based combat, exploration, and side-questing, combat is made 
			more complex through the following two mechanics: EMOTIONS, in which friends and foes alike are affected by varying and 
			leveling emotional statuses that are strong against one and weak against another, and FOLLOW-UPs: powerful skills that show off 
			the developing relationships between each of the characters in the party. These two mechanics also serve a thematic role, 
			reflecting the effect of emotional reactions on oneself and others, as well as the importance of developing healthy 
			relationships with others, regardless of how hard that may be.

			<h2>Art</h2>
			A visual embodiment of its theme of grief and healing, the visuals in OMORI oscillates between a childlike, colorful artstyle 
			and a grounded, occasionally horrifying one. This contrast vividly captures the essence of the emotional struggle of 
			experiencing loss during one's adolescence, another one of the game's major themes. Another potential interpretation I can 
			personally draw from this contrast is how human lives (originally happy, good, innocent) are affected by the knowledge or fear 
			of mortality, terrifying but nonetheless unavoidable. This artistic style is not limited to the backgrounds and setpieces, but 
			further extends to character design. The characters in OMORI are cute, memorable, and lovable, yet another stark contrast to 
			the realistic struggles they may suffer through despite their cartoonish and simple appearance.

			<h2>Story</h2>
			At its core, the story of OMORI is an exploration of the experience, coping of, and eventual acceptance of loss. You play as a 
			young, introverted shut-in who grew up happy with a group of friends that became fragmented when one of them unexpectedly 
			passes away. Throughout the game, the protagonist is presented with the choice of continuing a life of deceit, stuck trapped in 
			the past, or fighting to move on and face the truth of reality. Choosing the former means spending more time in HEADSPACE, the 
			fictional dream world within the mind of the protagonist where he is able to relive the wholesome life he once had. The latter 
			choice offers the opportunity to confront the once-happy group of friends and help them move on from their pain. I feel that 
			anyone living in the shadow of unresolved pain may see their struggles reflected in the protagonist's journey, and once offered 
			me insight into the importance of confronting painful truths and the power of acceptance.

			<h2>Characters</h2>
			The main characters in OMORI are beautifully flawed, each bearing their own burdens, all the while bound together through the 
			grief they share. The protagonist, along with MARI, HERO, KEL, AUBREY, and BASIL, represent the spectrum of coping mechanisms 
			people may employ in the face of trauma. The journey of each character reflects that of the player throughout the game, 
			allowing us to follow their struggles and growth. It was for this reason that I found it extremely easy to become attached to 
			these characters. Alongside this growth and development, the characters of OMORI each possesses an element of charm that makes 
			them individually unique!
