			<strong>Gameplay</strong><br>
			OMORI's gameplay intertwines traditional RPG elements with psychological horror, creating a labyrinthine world that mirrors 
			the convoluted journey of the mind  grappling with grief and despair. Players traverse both vibrant and shadowy realms, 
			solving puzzles that symbolize the process of piecing together repressed memories and confronting fears. The turn-based 
			combat system, infused with emotions that affect characters' abilities, reflects the real-life impact of feelings on our 
			strength and vulnerabilities. This mechanic speaks to individuals dealing with emotional upheaval, emphasizing that 
			acknowledging and facing one's emotions is a vital step toward healing.

			<strong>Art</strong><br>
			OMORI's art is a visual embodiment of its themes, oscillating between whimsical, colorful illustrations and stark, monochrome landscapes. 
			This contrast vividly captures the duality of the human psycheâ€”the external facade versus the internal struggle. The art's evocative 
			imagery and symbolism can resonate deeply with those who find themselves in the chasm between who they are and who they wish to be. It 
			illustrates the bleakness often encountered in the throes of mental illness but also hints at the possibility of beauty and hope on the 
			other side of suffering.

			<strong>Story</strong><br>
			At its core, OMORI's story is a poignant exploration of avoidance, guilt, and the eventual acceptance of loss. It unfolds in a dreamlike 
			world, where the protagonist, Omori, must confront his past and the darkness within. The narrative weaves through themes of friendship, 
			sacrifice, and the consequences of retreating into oneself. Those experiencing bereavement or living in the shadow of unresolved 
			issues may see their struggles mirrored in Omori's journey, offering insight into the importance of confronting painful truths and the 
			transformative power of acceptance.

			<strong>Characters</strong><br>
			The characters in OMORI are beautifully flawed, each bearing their own burdens and secrets, yet bound by deep bonds of friendship. Omori, 
			Sunny, Basil, and their friends represent the spectrum of coping mechanisms individuals employ in the face of trauma. Their interactions, 
			filled with moments of joy, pain, and revelation, serve as a reminder that we are not alone in our suffering. For anyone wrestling with 
			loneliness or misunderstood emotions, these characters underscore the value of empathy, understanding, and the courage to reach out 
			for support. Encompassing Human nature, to me, these characters common coping mechanisms to loss
