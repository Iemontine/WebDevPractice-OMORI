			<h2>Gameplay</h2>
			OMORI intertwines traditional top-down JRPG elements with psychological horror, and encourages players to traverse the convoluted world forged by a mind grappling with grief and loneliness. Although featuring a relatively standard turn-based combat system, the interesting-looking enemies, challenging boss fights, and fun character-specific attacks keep things feeling fresh while you strive to move the story forward. On top of turn-based combat, exploration, and side-questing, combat is made more complex through the following two mechanics: EMOTIONS, in which friends and foes alike are affected by varying and leveling emotional statuses that are strong against one and weak against another, and FOLLOW-UPs: powerful skills that show off the developing pairings between each of the characters in the party. These two mechanics also serve a story role, reflecting the impact of emotions on one's strength and vulnerabilities as well as the importance of developing healthy relationships with others, regardless of how hard that may be.

			<h2>Art</h2>
			A visual embodiment of its theme of grief and healing, the visuals in OMORI oscillates between a childlike, colorful artstyle and a monochromatic, unsettling one. This contrast vividly captures the essence of the emotional struggle spurred on by the loss of a loved one, another one of the game's major themes. Another potential interpretation I can personally draw from this how our lives (originally happy, good, innocent) are affected by human mortality, a terrifying but nonetheless unavoidable part of human existence. This is artistic style is not limited to the backgrounds and setpieces, but further extends to character design. The characters in OMORI are cute, memorable, and lovable, yet another stark contrast to the real-world struggles they may go through despite their cartoonish and simple appearance.

			<h2>Story</h2>
			At its core, OMORI's story is an exploration of the experience, coping of, and eventual acceptance of loss. You play as an introverted shut-in who

			It unfolds in a dreamlike world, where the protagonist, Omori, must confront his past and the darkness within. The narrative weaves through themes of friendship, sacrifice, and the consequences of retreating into oneself. Those experiencing bereavement or living in the shadow of unresolved issues may see their struggles mirrored in Omori's journey, offering insight into the importance of confronting painful truths and the transformative power of acceptance.

			<h2>Characters</h2>

			
			The characters in OMORI are beautifully flawed, each bearing their own burdens and secrets, yet bound by deep bonds of friendship. Omori, Sunny, Basil, and their friends represent the spectrum of coping mechanisms individuals employ in the face of trauma. Their interactions, filled with moments of joy, pain, and revelation, serve as a reminder that we are not alone in our suffering. For anyone wrestling with loneliness or misunderstood emotions, these characters underscore the value of empathy, understanding, and the courage to reach out for support. Encompassing Human nature, to me, these characters common coping mechanisms to loss
